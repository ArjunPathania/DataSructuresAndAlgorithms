# 100 Days of DSA - Study & Problem Solving 💻

Welcome to my **100 Days of Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** repository! 📚

This repo will serve as a log of my daily DSA study sessions and problem-solving practice. The goal is to enhance my understanding of DSA concepts, improve coding efficiency, and tackle algorithmic challenges.

## 📅 Challenge Overview

**Start Date:** _[Insert start date here]_

Over the course of 100 days, I will study DSA topics and solve algorithmic problems regularly. The journey will include:

- 📂 Studying core DSA concepts.
- 🧠 Solving problems related to each topic.
- 📖 Working through a "Problem of the Day" daily.

## 📁 Folder Structure

The repository is structured into different folders based on DSA topics and a dedicated section for the daily problem-solving challenge:

- `01-Basics`: Basics of C/C++ (language fundamentals).
- `02-SortingTechniques`: Exploration of different sorting algorithms.
- `03-Arrays`: Understanding arrays and their applications.
- Additional topic folders will be added as I progress.

### Problem of the Day

I solve a new DSA problem daily, and each solution is uploaded in the `Problem_of_the_Day` folder with the following format:

- `Problem_of_the_Day/oct_3_2024`: A new problem solution for October 3, 2024.
- `Problem_of_the_Day/oct_4_2024`: A new problem solution for October 4, 2024.
  
Each file will include the problem statement, approach, and the solution code.

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies

The tools and languages I will use throughout this challenge include:

- **C/C++**: Core language for DSA implementation.
- **Git & GitHub**: Version control and repository management.
- **Competitive Programming Platforms**: For practicing and solving problems.

## 🚀 Goals

- Strengthen my understanding of core DSA concepts.
- Improve problem-solving skills and coding efficiency.
- Create a comprehensive portfolio of solved problems and DSA projects.

## 📜 Documentation

For each folder, I will include:

- A description of the topic being studied.
- Solutions to problems related to the topic.
- Takeaways and key concepts learned.
- Resources and references.
